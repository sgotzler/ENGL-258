<p>In this course, we will be engaging in self-directed learning through a system of side quests. In brief, at least once during the semester students will complete an assignment chosen from a list of several possible options, and as the semester progresses new side-quests will become available, increasing the range of student choice. 
</p>
<p>These side-quests assignments will pose a combination of both creative and critical challenges to students and are designed to leverage aspects of self-directed learning to enhance student engagement by emphasizing autonomy, mastery, and purpose.</p>
