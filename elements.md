<h2 id="content">Self-Directed Mid-Term</h2>
<p>In this course, we will be engaging in self-directed learning through a system of side quests. In brief, at least once during the semester students will complete an assignment chosen from a list of several possible options, and as the semester progresses new side-quests will become available, increasing the range of student choice. 
</p>
<p>These side-quests assignments will pose a combination of both creative challenges and critical explorations for students and are designed to leverage aspects of self-directed learning to enhance student engagement by emphasizing autonomy, mastery, and purpose.</p>

		<h3>Autobiography of Play</h3>
		<p>This side-quest assignment asks you to reflect upon your own experience of meaningful play, and consider what factors (social, historical, geographical, cultural, etc.) may have figured importantly in shaping that experience. It will ask you to reflect upon questions such as: How have I come to understand my own relationship to games? What factors might have been important in shaping that relationship? What, or where, is my gaming community and who am I when I am “at home” there?</p>

		<h3>High Concept Design Sketch</h3>
		<p>This side-quest assignment asks you to sketch a high concept for a game design that uses meaningful play to make an argument, or offer a provocation, about some aspect of historical, political, or cultural significance. These high concept sketches should use critical insights to re-frame fundamental design considerations like: What are players trying to do? What kinds of decisions or relationships will the game ask players to confront or inhabit?</p>

		<h3><em>Stardew</em> Poetry</h3>
		<p>This side-quest assignment asks you to compose a pastoral poem inspired by the gameplay of <em>Stardew Valley</em>. For this side-quest, students are encouraged to take a cut-and-mix approach to poetic composition by interweaving selections from the poetry we read in class (e.g., whole lines, specific images, details, or poetic constructions) with textual elements drawn from <em>Stardew's</em> gameplay (e.g., NPC dialogue, non-diegetic textual instructions, or diegetic textual references, allusions, and description).</p>

		<h3>Historical Investigation</h3>
		<p>This side-quest assignment asks you to investigate a historical topic of interest to you. For instance, examining a single literary author’s life and career, the reception of a literary work, or the development and release of a notable game. You might also investigate broader aspects of historical context related to games and literature, such as a literary circle or movement or the history of a particular genre of game, or the advent of a new gaming technology.</p>

		<h3>Rules Re-Write</h3>
		<p>This side-quest assignment asks you to re-write the rules to an existing game design. Your re-writes should critique, subvert, counteract, or simply re-imagine the operative frameworks for play that emerge from the game when played according to its original rules. For this side-quest, students are encouraged to tackle a game that is relatively simple, and culturally familiar, (e.g., Monopoly, RISK, Clue), or one that we have examined and/or played in class (e.g., Settlers of Catan, or Puerto Rico).</p>
