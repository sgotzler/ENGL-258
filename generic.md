### Assignments & Expectations

---

#### Weekly Readings and Gameplay
Everything we do in this course will be rooted in two core activities: close reading and critical play. 

Critical and scholarly sources will be excerpted, and uploaded to Canvas. Several of these readings will be required during the first two weeks, but will become optional once the peer discussion facilitation begins (weeks 3-7; 9; 11-14). That being said, students are encouraged to examine or skim optional readings at their discretion and according to their inclination, as many may be helpful for developing their final projects. 

A significant portion of our class time in the Gameroom will be used to facilitate critical play of featured titles. To facilitate this, we will work together to play, watch, and discuss these titles at the 5 gaming stations in small groups.

*Expectation and Effort:* In addition to seminar discussions and gameplay sessions held during class time, students will be expected to complete a regular weekly reading load of anywhere between 90-120 pages (45-60 pages of fiction per class session, M/W).  The category “Attendance and Participation” accounts for 10% of the final grade in this course. Participation is assessed by your record of attendance, the frequency and quality of your contributions to discussion, and 2 self-assessment surveys (at mid-term, and end of term). The best way to ensure full credit for participation is to stay on top of the weekly reading assignments—including rulebooks or other game related preparatory materials—and come to class prepared to contribute to discussion, and/or engage in the play session with the appropriate level of critical focus.

#### Play Journal Essays
In this course, we will be keeping course journals. These journals will be created and maintained independently by the students, and are designed to provide a space for students to engage in deliberate guided reflection and practical experimentation related to games and literature. 

Twice throughout the semester, students will use the notes and observations contained in these play journals to produce a thesis driven essay that presents a comparative analysis of a literary text that we have read and a game that we have played. Students will do this once for each—so 1 essay focusing on a game in light of literary study, and 1 essay focusing on a literary text in light of critical gaming. In the course of their argument, student’s essays should use the literary and critical gaming concepts we discuss in class to develop their claims, and should draw upon salient textual details as supporting evidence (i.e., theme, setting, mechanic, narrative structure, symbol, player experience, etc.).

*Expectations and Effort:* Essays should be approx. 500-750 words in length. I will distribute further materials about best practices for writing critical essays at a later date, and we’ll model literary and gamic analysis in our reading discussions and gameplay activities. [Play Journal Essay Rubric is available on Canvas](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/50647/assignments/379809), essays will be assessed on 25 pt. scale across 5 categories: structure, argument, evidence, language, and presentation.

These essays will be submitted on a rolling basis over two windows throughout the term. Students are required to submit one essay during each window. 

The first essay submission window will open on **Friday 02.02.24** and close on **Friday 03.01.24**. 

The second essay submission window will open on **Friday 03.22.24** and close on **Friday 04.19.24**.

#### Discussion Facilitation
Once during the semester students will work in groups of 2-3 to take on responsibility to facilitate discussion during a class session. 

Think of this less as a formal presentation, and more as a commitment to conduct extra preparation. During the week that you facilitate, you will be responsible for not only keeping up with the 90-120 pages of fiction reading, but also putting together a plan for facilitating discussion (e.g., open-ended questions, guiding observations, points for debate). Facilitation will only account for a fraction of that day’s activities, roughly 1/3 (i.e., 25-30 min) – you do not need to construct an 80min lecture, you simply are responsible for getting our conversation started that week.

*Expectations and Effort:* Students will need to coordinate with their partner(s) and correspond with the instructor in advance (either on email or over zoom) to ensure that prep is going smoothly. 

**NOTE:** While students are encouraged to sign-up for the week whose content interests them most, they should also think carefully about which week works best for their workload in their other classes, and schedule accordingly. [Facilitation Rubric is available on Canvas](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/50647/assignments/379802), this assignment will be assessed on a 30-pt. scale, covering: planning, preparation, and execution.

Students may schedule a slot for facilitation duties using this [**Sign-Up Sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pIV1e6BwB4eSKCSTZp3vYZjTxJKghnZW-tfq-zPInXI/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Side Quests: Self-Directed Mid-Term
In this course, we will be engaging in self-directed learning through a system of side quests. In brief, at least once during the semester students will complete an assignment chosen from a list of several possible options, and as the semester progresses new side-quests will become available, increasing the range of student choice. 

These side-quests assignments will pose a combination of both creative and critical challenges to students and are designed to leverage aspects of self-directed learning to enhance student engagement by emphasizing autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

Twice throughout the semester, in week 8 and week 15 we will dedicate class time to a ‘showcase’ of completed side-quests, where students will give a brief presentation on their chosen projects and receive feedback from their peers. All students are required to complete at least 1 side-quest during the semester, but if they choose to complete additional side-quests there will be opportunities to earn extra credit towards their final grade. 

The first set of side-quests available to students will be shared at the end of week 2 (**01.19.24**), all students must submit at least 1 completed side-quest assignment no later than the end of week 15 (**04.26.24**). 

More specific information regarding this assignment can be found on the [**Side Quests**]() page of the course website.

#### FINAL: Class Portfolio Contribution
The capstone assignment for this course will be a contribution to a class portfolio that collects our various explorations of, and interventions in, the study of games and literature. Contributions to class portfolio may take a number of specific forms, but in general will fall into 1 of 2 general categories: 

>**Research Essay Contributions** — approaching topics in critical gaming and literary study through a critical essay that engages in secondary research. Critical essays should exhibit lively but informative prose, and address a generally educated public audience. They should bring the resources of literary study and/or critical gaming to bear on a particular theme, issue, or text of interest that directly engages with the course questions. For example, exploring the politics of form, the history of genre formations, specific authors/books or designers/games, or adaptation studies. Critical Essays should be between 1500-2500 words in length, or 8-10min in audio or video format, and they must utilize 3-5 secondary sources.

>**Game Design Contributions** — approaching topics in critical gaming and literary study through a creative project in game design. These might include: using web apps like TWINE to develop a text-based digital game, writing an original campaign narrative, developing a character creation system, player’s guide, or monster manual for a role-playing game, or even putting together a prototype of a board game or card game. Game Design contributions will be accompanied by a brief designer’s note (500-750 words) that communicates the designer’s choices, and explains their critical intent. They must also include any additional necessary procedural documents (e.g., rulebooks, installation instructions, etc.)

*Expectation and Effort:* Students will schedule a 1-on-1 conference with their instructor at mid-term to begin brainstorming ideas for their contribution. This meeting will be followed by the submission of a brief, but formal, proposal for their portfolio contribution. These proposals should be no more than 2 pages in length and should include: (1) a description of the student’s project choice, (2) a justification of the project’s relevance to the course aims and content, (3) a preliminary outline of a plan of work w/timeline for completing the project.

These contributions will be collected, and published online in a course website via TarHeels.live  

Class Portfolio Contributions will be due **Friday, 05/03/24**
